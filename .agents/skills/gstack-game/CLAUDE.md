# gstack-game development

## Commands

```bash
bun run build                    # generate all SKILL.md from templates
bun run gen:skill-docs           # same as build
bun run gen:skill-docs:check     # check for drift without writing (CI use)
bun test                         # run Tier 1 validation tests (free, <2s)
```

## Testing

```bash
bun test                         # run before every commit — free, <2s
```

`bun test` runs template validation: frontmatter checks, preamble injection verification,
placeholder expansion, drift detection, and tier validation. All 14 tests must pass before committing.

## SKILL.md workflow

SKILL.md files are **generated** from `.tmpl` templates. Never edit SKILL.md directly.

1. Edit the `.tmpl` file (e.g. `skills/game-review/SKILL.md.tmpl`)
2. Run `bun run build`
3. Commit both the `.tmpl` and generated `.md` files

**Merge conflicts on SKILL.md files:** Never resolve conflicts on generated SKILL.md
files by accepting either side. Instead: (1) resolve conflicts on the `.tmpl` templates,
(2) run `bun run build` to regenerate, (3) stage the regenerated files.

## Writing SKILL templates

SKILL.md.tmpl files are **prompt templates read by Claude**, not bash scripts.
Each bash code block runs in a separate shell — variables do not persist between blocks.

Rules:
- **Use natural language for logic and state.** Don't use shell variables to pass
  state between code blocks. Tell Claude what to remember in prose.
- **Keep bash blocks self-contained.** Each code block should work independently.
- **Express conditionals as English.** Instead of nested `if/elif/else` in bash,
  write numbered decision steps.
- **Every section ends with** `**STOP.** One issue per AskUserQuestion.`
- **Include AUTO/ASK/ESCALATE** classification for every section.
- **Include anti-sycophancy** forbidden phrases and calibrated acknowledgment examples.
- **Include quantitative scoring** where applicable (explicit formula, not AI intuition).

### Placeholders

| Placeholder | Resolves to |
|-------------|-------------|
| `{{PREAMBLE}}` | Tier-assembled preamble (core + standard + expert + telemetry based on `preamble-tier`) |
| `{{SKILL_NAME}}` | Directory name of the skill (e.g. `game-review`) |

### Preamble tiers

| Tier | Skills | Includes |
|------|--------|----------|
| T1 | careful, guard, unfreeze, game-docs | core + telemetry |
| T2 | 17 design/review skills | + voice, AskUser, vocabulary, routing |
| T3 | 7 expert/production skills | + scope drift, review staleness |

### Template format

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: "One-line description."
user_invocable: true
preamble-tier: 2
---
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED from SKILL.md.tmpl — do not edit directly -->
<!-- Regenerate: bun scripts/gen-skill-docs.ts -->

{{PREAMBLE}}

# /my-skill: Title

[Content with sections, scoring, AUTO/ASK/ESCALATE, anti-sycophancy]

## Review Log

\```bash
[ -n "$_GG_BIN" ] && "$_GG_BIN/gstack-review-log" '{"skill":"{{SKILL_NAME}}","timestamp":"TIMESTAMP","status":"STATUS","commit":"COMMIT"}' 2>/dev/null || true
\```
```

## Adding a new skill

1. Create `skills/my-skill/SKILL.md.tmpl` with YAML frontmatter + `{{PREAMBLE}}`
2. Follow the 6 gstack methodology principles:
   - Classify before judging (mode selection, category system)
   - Explicit scoring formula (not AI intuition)
   - Action triage (AUTO/ASK/ESCALATE with clear boundaries)
   - Structured AskUserQuestion (4-part: re-ground, simplify, recommend, options)
   - Multi-dimensional cross-check (multiple passes)
   - Anti-sycophancy (forbidden phrases + forcing questions + push-back cadence)
3. Run `bun run build`
4. Run `bun test` to verify
5. Commit both `.tmpl` and `.md` files

## Design principles

1. **Interactive, not automated.** One issue at a time via AskUserQuestion. User decides.
2. **Opinionated with reasoning.** Every recommendation includes WHY and an alternative.
3. **Game-specific vocabulary.** Core loop, retention hook, sink/faucet, difficulty curve.
4. **Works with any engine.** Reviews design docs and specs, not engine-specific code.
5. **Complete workflow.** Not a supplement to gstack — a full replacement for game projects.

## Quality tiers

| Tier | Quality | What it has |
|------|---------|-------------|
| B-type (70-80%) | Production | Full domain theory + scoring formulas + forcing questions |
| A-type (55-65%) | Usable | Complete structure + game vocabulary + AUTO/ASK/ESCALATE |
| Skeleton (35-40%) | Draft | Structure only, content needs domain expert calibration |

See `docs/domain-judgment-gaps.md` for what each skill needs from which expert.

## Commit style

Bisect commits — each commit should be a single logical change. Examples:
- Template changes separate from generated file regeneration
- New skills separate from infrastructure changes
- Content enhancements separate from structural refactors

## CHANGELOG style

CHANGELOG.md is **for users**. Write it like product release notes:
- Lead with what the user can now **do**
- Plain language, not implementation details
- No internal tracking or contributor-facing details

## Reference sources

When enhancing skills with domain knowledge, consult:
- **gstack original** (`C:\ai_project\gstack`) — methodology and engineering patterns
- **Claude-Code-Game-Studios** (`C:\game-dev\Claude-Code-Game-Studios`) — game design theory (MDA, SDT, economy frameworks)
- **guardian** (`C:\ai_project\guardian`) — PlayerSimulatorAgent prompt, Iceberg validation framework
- **gstack research docs** (`C:\ai_project\guardian\docs\tech\gstack-*.md`) — 3 methodology analysis docs
